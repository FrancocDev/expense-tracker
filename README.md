#Expense Tracker

This is a project to track expenses that uses React, tailwind and the new Preact signals to learn about it and because I think that is so good and much more intuitive to handle global state than other solutions.

I take some decisions like using uncontrolled forms in order to avoid re-renders while using the defaultValue with the props when edit instead of updating constantly the state to make it controlled and only handle the data onSubmit event.
